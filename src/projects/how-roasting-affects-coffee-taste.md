**One of the most significant influences on coffee taste is roast level,** when you are out discovering new coffees most of them come in four different roast levels. Thus, in this post we will help you understand the four major ones and help you find your perfect match. Lets get to it.

### Light Roast
As the name suggests, light roasts are lighter in color, mostly light brown. This level of roast is used when the preservation of flavour and aroma of the coffee beans is needed. They are drier with no oil on its surface. This is due to the short amount of period they are roasted.

They are heated in a temperature range of 175 â€“ 205 degrees. Some popular categories in it include Light City, Half City and Cinnamon. While these beans are roasted just before the first crack appears, there is another category known as New England Roast which refers to beans roasted til the first crack forms.

### Medium Roast
Medium roasts are able to retain the aroma and flavor of coffee beans up to an extent. They are dry and lack oil on their surface. This roast level has less caffeine than the lighter roasts.

For achieving medium roast levels, you need to heat the coffee beans between 205 and 220 degrees. Usually, the beans are roasted till the first crack is complete and the second crack starts to appear.

Some popular roast names for this roast level are Regular Roast, City Roast, American Roast and Breakfast Roast.

### Medium-Dark Roast

In medium-dark roasts the beans start to get some oil on their surface and a darker color to them. They also have a heavier body when compared to lighter and medium roasts. This roast level makes the coffee spicy in taste.

To achieve medium-dark roast levels the beans need to be heated between 225 to 235 degrees. The beans need to be roasted till the start or middle of the second crack.

They are also known as After-Dinner Roast, Full-City Roast and Vienna Roast.

### Dark Roast

By this level the natural aroma and flavour of the coffee beans is replaced by the roast. The beans are dark brown with an oily surface. The caffeine in the beans is fairly reduced and they develop a burnt and ashy taste to them.

To reach the dark roasts level the coffee beans need to be heated in between 240 to 250 degrees. The coffee beans are heated until the second crack is completed and sometimes even further.

Some popular names include Italian Roast, French Roast, Continental Roast and Espresso Roast.
